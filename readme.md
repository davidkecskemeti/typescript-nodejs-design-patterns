# Node.js Design Patterns with TypeScript

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems in software application development.

There are 3 types of design patterns:

- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral

Creational pattern is concerned with the way we create object in an OO style. It applies the patterns in how to instantiate a class.

Structural pattern is concerned with how our classes and objects are composed to form a larger structure in our application.

Behavioral pattern is concerned about how the objects can interact efficiently without being tightly coupled.

The following design patterns will be:

- Singleton
- Abstract factory
- Builder
- Adapter
- Strategy
- Observer
- Facade
